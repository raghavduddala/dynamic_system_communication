 

Let us first try getting working with 
a. DDPG with Sparse, binary rewards (Since using DDPG, let us use only a single gym environment and not randomize it )
b. Then Use HER with DDPG 
c. Make a random disturbance to the force and see if we can capture those changes in the observer 


Then complete the rest of Implementation with :
a. HER with randomization using RDPG
